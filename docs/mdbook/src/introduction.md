# Introduction

The [Vollo Trees SDK](https://github.com/MyrtleSoftware/vollo-trees-sdk) is designed for
low latency streaming inference of decision tree models on FPGA
platforms.

> :mag_right: See [Vollo](https://vollo.myrtle.ai/latest/) for the parent product designed
> for low latency streaming inference on Neural Networks.

You can estimate the latency of your model using the Vollo Trees SDK without needing
an FPGA or a Vollo license, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for
details.
