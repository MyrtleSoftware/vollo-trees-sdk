# Versions

## Version Compatibility

The Vollo Trees SDK follows a semantic versioning scheme.
If the left-most non-zero component (major/minor/patch) of the version number
is unchanged between two releases of the Vollo Trees SDK, it should be possible to
update to the newer version without modifying your existing code, e.g. updating
from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1.

Additionally, the FPGA bitstream is stable between patch releases, so you do
not have to reprogram the FPGA with an updated Vollo Trees bitstream unless the
minor or major version numbers have changed.
