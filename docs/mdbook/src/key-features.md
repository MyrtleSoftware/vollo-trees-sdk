# Key Features

Vollo Trees accelerates machine learning inference for low latency streaming models
typically found in financial trading or fraud detection systems such as:

- Market predictions
- Risk analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Portfolio optimisation

Key characteristics of Vollo Trees are:

- Low latency inference decision tree models, typically between 1.9-2.4Î¼s.
- High density processing in a 1U server form factor suitable for co-located
  server deployment.
- Compiles decision tree models for use on the accelerator.
